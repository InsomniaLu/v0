# What is Reinforcement Learning?

  - RL is a general-purpose framework for sequential decision-making. 
  - It is a field of Machine Learning which deals with an unsupervised task which involves learning strategies to maximize a cumulative reward and learning on-the-go.
  - It is usually described as an agent interacting with an unknown environment.
  - To give a simple example by contrast, consider self-driving cars. The supervised Machine Learning approach is to collect a dataset of observations vs ideal actions, and map a model (like a Neural Network) to approximate the prediction of ideal action. The RL way of doing this is to conduct various simulations of the experiment, and learn solely based on observations and ‘rewards’ which are basically measures of how favourable each outcome is. The drawback is, we need to conduct a large amount of experiments and simulations. The advantage is, we do not need any training data, and we have the opportunity to learn the optimal strategy, ie, and be better than a human driver. One can also say that while supervised ML algorithms are used for function approximation, RL is a framework for learning strategies and optimization.

# Who would need RL?

  - **Applied ML Scientists/ Data Scientists in Robotics/Finance modeling domain** - While RL has a rich history in robotics applications and learning strategies to implement complicated tasks, RL has also been used heavily in the financial domain for portfolio optimization and learning trading strategies. Recent advances in Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning has also allowed for usage of dense and high dimensional data to its full potential.
  - **Researchers** - RL is a fascinating research subject with applications in the real world. Due to computational resources that are available in modern times, RL has become not only feasible but also essential in learning strategy based tasks across applications in Biochemistry, Recommendation systems, bidding & advertising optimization.

# What are Pre-requisites for getting started in RL?
Basics of statistics, linear algebra, Machine Learning and Probability theory. RL is a much more mathematically heavy subject, and from personal experience if Deep Learning requires high school level calculus and probability, then RL might require at least undergrad level fundamentals. Since modern RL also involves using Deep Learning, implementation level knowledge of DL will also prove useful but not necessary. Based on the application, even knowledge of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, and corresponding coding implementations will also prove useful.

  - Reinforcement Learning : an Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto ([free online version](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf))
  - [Teaching material](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) from David Silver including video lectures is a great introductory course on RL.
  - [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) is a toolkit for building and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It is highly suggested to practise algorithms and techniques on these simulated environments.
