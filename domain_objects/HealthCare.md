**EHR**

It is an electronic system which is characterized to store patient&#39;s medical data across clinical and healthcare administrations. This system is effective in maintaining clinical workflows and individual patient&#39;s data records.

**Significance** : EHR have a viable and convenient form of data collection which can be readily shared and transferred from one healthcare unit to another without much hassles. This enables in a better leverage of data for quality and improvement checks. EHR plays a crucial role in improving public health reporting and surveillance. It helps to build a smooth platform between the health officials and health care providers.

**CRM**

Customer Relationship Management in healthcare is an effective tool use to build important relation across various crucial parameters related to healthcare management. Several independent parameters like patients medical history, dosage, assigned doctors, supporting infrastructure, etc. can all be brought under strategic management within a software. This helps in quick, transparent and effective evaluation of statistical data related to the subject concern.

**VERBAL AUTOPSY**

Verbal Autopsy is usually incorporated to collect and analyze data related to the symptoms and conditions related to the cause of death. This process enables to study the circumstances responsible towards the causing of death, thereby providing crucial conclusions regarding the deceased person&#39;s illness and health data.

**Significance:** VA helps drastically when collaborated with researchers and medical units. The observations deduced from the Verbal Autopsy can prove lethal in explaining the cause of intense medical conditions of the specimen, thereby aiding the health control management to closely operate and function on the same. It plays an important role in health surveillance as well, which in turn emboldens the social and health fabric of a society to formidable levels.

### Data Storage

Data storage in a healthcare comes as crucial component in driving the statistical data and reports into structured medical databases. These healthcare databases act as a storage warehouse which in turn equips the key information and stats related to several important parameters related to healthcare standards. To access such robust databases, the health care industry primarily employs on the SQL query management systems to fetch information specific to folders and identified units.

**SQL database**

**Structured Query Language** are those vital queries which are managed to fetch information and manipulate the exiting databases. In health care industry, its utility is precise in evaluating features and components from the structured units installed in the database to gain important relations and deduce critical conclusions related to health conditions.

### Data Governance

It comprises as the foremost functional channel to regulate a plethora of operations working under the system. The timely operation, functioning, security, compliance, etc. are all governed by **data governance** units set forth by the management **.** This can include people, processes, technologies, units, etc. to derive out the necessary set of validations and checks.

**Significance:** Data Governance has a primary objective to hold compliance and integrity at the first place. In a healthcare industry the data governance processes are highly valued and followed, making it crucial while making health care decisions. A robust Data Governance ensures the integrity and sustenance of a database maintaining its consistency and trustworthiness across various health care standards.

### Data Visualization

Data Visualization techniques usually employ charts, graphs and plots to figure out trends and patterns related to the subject data. Its utility in the healthcare mechanism is immense as it helps in transferring the results and observations in a much quicker and a precise format across departments. This leads to faster deductions and timely analysis.

**Plotly**

Plotly are the hosting units that preserves the visualizations in an online library resource which can be retrieved regularly for evaluation and observation processes. It is imperative to know here that a plotly library is used to draw basic interactive plots which helps tremendously in studying data visualizations and trends.
