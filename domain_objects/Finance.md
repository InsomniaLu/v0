# Data Science & Finance
There are several primary sub-domains within finance.  Some examples include; corporate finance, investment banking, personal financial planning, and insurance [1].  In each of these sub-domains companies are beginning to see the value in data science and associated skills such as information systems and business analytics [2].  Companies are looking to hire people with both data science and domain expertise.  This article will outline some of examples of work being done in finance and the skills needed to be successful. 

## What are some examples of data science in finance?
***Process Automation***  
Most companies have legacy manual processes that are used to produce reports, update records, and deliver analysis.  These tasks often remain manual due to the way the data is collected, lack of documented requirements, or the ability of the team to automate the process.  Where data science can help is to provide the data management skillsets needed to transform the process from copy/paste to a sustainable automation with robust checks.  One challenge when automating processes is understanding the reason for particular steps and checks in the process.  It is important to understand the purpose of the process and to provide adequate checks so that management has insight into how the reports are produced.  Documentation is another critical component to process automation and is often required due to regulatory considerations.
  
***Executive Dashboards and Reports***  
A common deliverable in finance is a dashboard or a report.  The ability to conduct analysis of a particular topic and deliver the results clearly is important in finance.  This requires design, data visualization, domain knowledge, and communication skills to be effective.  Dashboards and reports can also be thought of to show what happened, why it happened, what might happen, and what decisions can be made to change the outcome.  
  
***Credit and Collections Scoring***  
A more specific use case is scoring customers based on their likelihood to pay a particular invoice on time.  This is important for a company to know as on time payments effect cash flow and other cash related metrics.  An effective prediction of late payment using machine learning techniques can help the team to identify which invoices to prioritize or could even inform an automated collections process that is different for customer that are more likely to pay late.  A project of this nature would require data infrastructure, machine learning, statistics, and communication skills.   Domain knowledge also plays an important role.  How the data is collected, the collections process and the implications of each should be taken into account when designing a predictive model.  
  
***Cash Flow Forecasting***  
Forecasting is a core component of financial management.  Similar to setting a personal budget a company needs to plan around how much cash they expect as income and how much they will need to pay out in a given period.  Traditionally these models are created using simple averages and assumptions but more sophisticated methods are now being used.  Specifically time series, statistics, and machine learning skills are required to implement more advanced forecasts.  It is also important to keep track of the different components and have some way to explain the models forecast.   
  
  
## What skills do I need?  
* **Domain Knowledge:**  Domain knowledge can be learned on the job but there are other ways to learn about finance.  Methods such as finding a mentor, reading financial publications, or exploring professional designations can be effective in developing domain knowledge.  
* **Presentation and Communication:**  These are critical skills to effectively present analysis and research.  Concisely communicating the impact of the analysis or the benefits of a new machine learning model will be essential for acceptance and adoption.  
* **Project Management:**  Often you will be working with other subject matter experts, developers, and executive sponsors.  Developing planning and project management skills will be helpful in executing the project successfully and on time.  
* **Data Engineering:**  Whether you are automating a process, designing a visualization, or building a new model you will be working with data.  Learning SQL, programming languages, and other data engineering tools will help you to execute the project.  
* **Data Visualization:**  As mentioned in the project examples data visualization is a key delivery method of analysis in finance.  Developing good design skills comes with practice but looking at other examples such as those on Tableau Public are a good way to build design and data communication skills.  
* **General Statistics:**  Many of the financial metrics utilize basic math but the analysis of financial results benefits from an understanding of statistics.  Questions such as what is the distribution of revenue per customer will require some general statistics knowledge.  
* **Time series:**  Time series models and the associated statistics are used when creating forecasts for financial metrics.  In addition to the mathematical background it is helpful to understand the programming implementations of the models.  
* **Machine Learning:**  Machine learning is increasingly being applied to finance.  One challenge is that often the model needs to be explainable.  Since the models are typically being used to inform decisions executives will want to understand the assumptions made by the models and the general patterns that the model has identified.   This means that linear regression, logistic regression, and decision tree models are good places to start before moving to a more advanced model.

## What specific tools should I focus on learning?

    * Numpy
    * Statsmodels
    * Prophet
    * Matplotlib
    * Sklearn
    * CX_Oracle – Or another python package to work with SQL databases

## Related Fields  
* **Marketing:**  This field is related when analyzing the financial impact of marketing campaigns.  You may be using similar data but with different goals.  
* **Sales:**  Sales is directly related to revenue.  You may be using similar datasets and analysis to identify areas of opportunity.  
* **Customer Service:**  Customer service and its relation to customer retention can have some cross over with corporate finance.   =
