## What is PyTorch and what is it used for?
 - [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org/) is one of the most popular libraries for numerical computation and currently is amongst the most widely used libraries for performing machine learning research. 
 - In many ways PyTorch is similar to NumPy, with the additional benefit that PyTorch allows you to perform your computations on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs without any material change to your code. PyTorch also makes it easy to distribute your computation across multiple devices or machines
 - PyTorch was primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. Along with Tensorflow, it is one of, if not *the* most popular DL frameworks in with a substantial community and well maintained documentation.
 - A number of pieces of Deep Learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including [Tesla Autopilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot), Uber's Pyro, HuggingFace's Transformers, PyTorch Lightning, and Catalyst.

## Who would need PyTorch?
 - Anyone getting started with Deep Learning and wanting to learn the implementation of the algorithms paralelley while also understanding the theory. 
 - Seasoned programmers can also utilize PyTorch since it provides state-of-art implementation of various popular algorithms, and allows for smooth transition and intuitive interface for beginners. 
 - Non Deep Learning tasks which require fast and distributed matrix manipulations, and or some non predictive Computer Vision and NLP tasks may also utilize PyTorch.

## What are the prerequisites to learn PyTorch?
 - Basic understanding of Python and numpy is essential for PyTorch, but that doesn't mean you need to be a seasoned or an expert user.
 - Since it is primarily used in Deep Learning, it is a given that appropriate theoretical understanding of the concepts is essential before starting in PyTorch. There are various ways of writing a PyTorch code that is wrong but doesn't return an error.

## What should I choose between PyTorch vs Tensorflow/Keras?
 - If you are reading this around 2020, and getting started in Deep Learning, it is a safe bet and a good sign that you are facing this question. 
 - Python enthusiasts love PyTorch for its imperative programming style, which they see as more “pythonic” than that of other, more declarative frameworks. Given its pythonic nature, PyTorch fits smoothly into the Python machine learning ecosystem. More importantly, it is easier to understand and clarify exactly what is happening underneath the Deep Learning models, and we can check intermediate variables, and look at their shapes and distributions in case there is confusion. This means the code looks longer, but it also means it can be customized more, and a sometimes  weak concepts can be understood better by looking at the code.
 - Tensorflow and Keras used to be different libraries, however post 2019 Tensorflow integrates Keras by default. Keras makes the coding simplistic with fewer lines of code and readymade building blocks which significantly improve the speed at which even newcomers can implement deep-learning architectures. Codes look small and less messy. However it makes it difficult to know what is happening underneath, and may hamper customization. It can sometimes encourage programmers to venture into advanced concepts without understanding the theory, which is a dangerous path for a Data Scientist. 
 - Coming back to the question, if you want to make a choice, choose PyTorch if Deep Learning will occupy a large part of your occupation moving forward. Researchers, Programmers, Career Data Scientists, etc are included in this. If you are focused on the application, and do not see yourself digging too deep into research and development, Tensorflow/Keras is a better option, but not by far. 
 - Also, the differences are not huge to change your framework midway through learning one, great work and results have been achieved by people using either of the frameworks. The ultimate goals should be reaching a level of programming prowess and conceptual clarity, that you can easily adapt to the other framework over a couple of days.

## Where and how do I get started in PyTorch?
 - [PyTorch 60 minute blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) and [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) are good sources to start, and keeping the documentation tab open at all times while writing PyTorch code is a good idea.

 - [d2I PyTorch](https://github.com/dsgiitr/d2l-pytorch)


## What next?
 - Projects are a great way of testing your skills, especially picking problems and datasets that are previously unexplored and not easily found. 
 - This also includes exploring datasets accross various domains such as sound, text, video, biochemical datasets and problem statements like  classification, dimensionality reduction, denoising signals, text to audio and vice verse and Generative tasks.
 - [Awesome PyTorch list](https://github.com/bharathgs/Awesome-pytorch-list#awesome-pytorch-list) is great place to explore applications, tutorials and libraries that are built on top of PyTorch.
