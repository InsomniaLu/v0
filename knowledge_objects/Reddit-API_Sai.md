**Reddit API


**What is the Reddit API?**
Data scientists often look to social media platforms as places to draw data from. It’s really the perfect
place — there’s loads of data available, all free and open to the public. Reddit.com is a site built for
discussions and posts about topics, called ‘subreddits’, and it’s used daily by millions of users. Reddit
knows that their platform is a perfect target for data scraping, as all of the millions of conversations are
free to look at. Reddit developed an Application Programming Interface, or an API (in Reddit’s case called ​ PRAW ​), to allow data scientists to scrape easily.
