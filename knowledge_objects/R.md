### Strengths

- Statistical Modelling
- Large number of packages available
- Rapid prototyping and visualizations

### Limitations

- R is mainly built for data analysis and statistics hence support for machine learning and deep learning is limited compared to python.
- Slow / high learning curve.
- Not suited for production grade software
- Not suited for integrations with software&#39;s in other languages
- Not object-oriented
