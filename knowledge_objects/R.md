# R

What is R?

R is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) and [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) environment for [statistical computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_computing) and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.

Who should use R?

The R language is widely used among [statisticians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistician) and [data miners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) for developing [statistical software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_software) and [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis).

When should I use R?

- When one needs to do statistical modelling.
- Create, publish and share quick dashboards and applications without much technical expertise (using R Shiny)

How do I learn about it?

Strengths

- Statistical Modelling
- Large number of packages available
- Rapid prototyping and visualizations

Limitations

- R is mainly built for data analysis and statistics hence support for machine learning and deep learning is limited compared to python.
- Slow / high learning curve.
- Not suited for production grade software
- Not suited for integrations with software&#39;s in other languages
- Not object-oriented
