### Who should use Python?

Python boasts of wide variety of libraries which makes it good fit for software developers and data scientists.

### When should I use Python?

- For creating analytic software.
- For Machine Learning and NLP
- For integration with other software service or applications
- For visualizations

### Strengths

- Readable and Maintainable Code
- Easy to learn and get started
- Supports multiple programming paradigms like object oriented and structured programming

- Wide range of libraries and frameworks available for software development and data science
- Wide online user community support

### Limitations

- Python is not that well suited for web development compared to languages like Java
- Python support for statistical modelling is not as good as R.
- Since python is dynamically typed language, it is often susceptible to more bugs and thus it requires some additional testing effort.
- Comparatively slower than languages like C or C++.
