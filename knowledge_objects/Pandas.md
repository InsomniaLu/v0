# Pandas

### What is Pandas?

Pandas is an open-source, BSD-licensed Python library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

### Who should use Pandas?

Python with Pandas is used in a wide range of fields including academic and commercial domains including finance, economics, Statistics, analytics, etc.

### When should I use Pandas?

- For fast and efficient DataFrame object with default and customized indexing.
- For loading data into in-memory data objects from different file formats.
- For data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
- For reshaping and pivoting of date sets.
- For label-based slicing, indexing and sub setting of large data sets.
- For group by data for aggregation and transformations.
- For high performance merging and joining of data.
- For Time Series functionality.

### Strengths

- Efficient handling of huge data
- Lesser coding needed for different analytical operations compared to other languages or libraries
- Extensive feature set
- Easy customization of data

### Limitations

- Complex syntax which is not always in line with Python
- Learning curve
- Poor documentation
- Poor 3D matrix compatibility â€“ Pandas is built for 2D data. For 3D, numpy is preferred
