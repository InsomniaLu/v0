# MongoDB

What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is an open source NoSQL document database written in C, C++ and JavaScript. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents with schemas.

Who should use MongoDB?

MongoDB is built for people who are building internet and business applications who need to evolve quickly and scale elegantly.

When should I use MongoDB?

- When there is a need to store and manage unstructured data
- When there is a need for strong query language for exploring dataset that contains complex data structures
- When there is a need for production ready database – performance, high availability and scalability

How do I learn about it?

Strengths

- High Performance - Support for embedded data models reduces I/O on DB
- Rich query language
- High Availability - MongoDB&#39;s replication facility, replica set, provides automatic failover and data redundancy
- Horizontal Scalability - Sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines
- MongoDB Compass – Provides a GUI to visually explore the dataset and view and optimize the query performance
- Multi-cloud compatible – AWS, Azure, Google Cloud

Limitations

- No two NoSQL databases are equal and there are no defined standards for NoSQL databases.
- Lacks stored procedures equivalent from relational databases.
- Since python is dynamically typed language, it is often susceptible to more bugs and thus it requires some additional testing effort.
- Comparatively slower than languages like C or C++.
