# Numpy

### What is Numpy?

NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.

### Who should use Numpy?

Developers and data scientists who need to perform mathematical operations in python.

### When should I use Numpy?

- For mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
- For fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.
- For operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.

### Strengths

- Efficient memory utilization while handling of huge data
- Speed
- Matrix multiplication
- Vectorized operations
- Filtering operations
- Scientific operations

### Limitations

- Require a contiguous allocation of memory: Insertion and deletion operations become costly as data is stored in contiguous memory locations as shifting it requires shifting
