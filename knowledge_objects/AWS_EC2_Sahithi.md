**AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**

What is the AWS EC2?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.

Who Should Use AWS EC2?

Nowadays, many leading organizations are deploying applications on their Elastic Compute cloud instance. Since there are many types of instances depending on your application, this will help reduce the cost for many small scale businesses.
