# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
##### Author : Siddhesh Mirjankar


### What is a GAN?

GAN is an application of Computer Vision and Deep Learning that focuses on generation of images. This architecture was first created by Ian Goodfellow and a few of his colleagues in 2014. A GAN basically is a combination of two neural network architectures namely a Generator, and a Discriminator. 
The job of the Generator is to retrieve random noise from a latent space and convert it into an image. During the initial stages of training, the images generated by the Generator are full of noise but as the training time increases, it gets better at generating clear images. The job of the Discriminator is to predict whether the image received is real or fake. The input for the Discriminator is a combination of images from the user, and images generated by the Generator. It is important to understand the goal of a GAN. The Discriminator is considered successful when it can correctly identify images from the user as real, and images from the Generator as fake. The Generator is considered successful when it is able to generate an image that is able to fool the Discriminator into considering that image to be real instead of fake. Therefore, the objective of a GAN is to ensure that the Generator succeeds while the Discriminator fails.


### Applications of a GAN

- Simulating gravitational lensing for research in Dark Matter
- Generating photos of imaginary fashion models thereby cutting costs of hiring actual models
- Improving the quality of low resolution video games. Final Fantasy VIII, Final Fantasy IX and Resident Evil are few of the many video games that use GAN’s to enhance their quality
- Automated coloring of black and white photographs
- Translating photos from day to night


### Limitations of a GAN

- GAN’s need a huge amount of training data in order to generate good quality images.
- GAN’s can only combine different parts of images to form a new image. They cannot invent completely new things.
- The Generator and Discriminator need to be balanced. Therefore if any changes are made to the number of layers in the Generator, corresponding changes must be made in the Discriminator as well even if the Discriminator gives a satisfactory output.

### Code

I have implemented a GAN from scratch using tensorflow. The code is well commented in order to explain what each line of code accomplishes. The code and its output can be found on my [github](https://github.com/siddmirjank/Computer-Vision/tree/master/Fake%20Image%20Generator/tensorflow)
