# Java

What is Java?

Java is general purpose object-oriented programming language based on _write once, run anywhere (WORA)_ philosophy, i.e. the complied Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode) that can run on any [Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) (JVM) regardless of the underlying [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture). The [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) of [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)) is similar to [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), but has fewer [low-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language) facilities than either of them.

Who should use Java?

Software developers who intend to develop applications that are easy to maintain and are platform independent.

Strengths

- Code Reusability
- Speed – Using JVM for Just in Time compilation
- Object-oriented approach
- Platform independent - Write once run anywhere with JVM (Java Virtual machine)
- Good for large scale production grade application development
- Wide online user community support

Limitations

- Takes more time to learn compared to Python
- Comparatively slower than languages like C or C++.
- Not great for Exploratory Data Science
- Needs more memory
