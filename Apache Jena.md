# Apache Jena 

What is Apache Jena

In 2000 HP Labs began developing Jena and in 2010 Jena became part of the Apache Software Foundation [1]. Jena is open source and written in Java. Jena is a tool for the semantic web with Java libraries and APIs to develop tool and applications. Key distinguishes for Jena is its support of OWL and tools to publish RDF data. The semantic web, sometimes called web 3.0, is based on a concept of storing data differently than conventional relational databases. Storing data in RDF triples allows linkages between data that might otherwise remain disconnected. Jena is an application that provides the tools to help developers build applications to store, query and organize data in this RDF triples format.
There are several key elements to Jena that are best understood with a basic understanding of RDF. RDF or Resource Description Framework is a way to model and connect resources or objects. The building blocks in RDF are triples. Triples are built specifically in the Subject.Predicate.Object format. An example of a triple would be Wine.Color.Red
 The data model that is created storing data this way becomes a semantic graph. Jena is built to provide tools to work with RDF and the semantic web. Jena has some key libraries and capabilities that are key for developers buying into building applications in the ontological model. Jena RDF API is key to reading and building triples and RDF graphs. The Jena RDF API provides the basic create, read, update and delete functionality for dealing with triples in RDF. The Jena ARQ processor is another important tool in Jena’s tool kit that enables query using SPARQL [2]. On other key distinguisher of Jena is its support for OWL. OWL or the Web Ontology Language is way represent and build semantics of data similar but more extensible than RDF [3].

** Who should use Apache Jena

Jena is excellent open source tool for anyone who would like to leverage RDF (Resource Description Framework) or OWL (Web Ontology Language) for the for the semantic web.
When should I use Apache Jena
One of the main goals of the semantic web is to make the vast amount of data on the internet machine readable. The semantic web enables automation, refined information retrieval, and knowledge discovery. As a data scientist the concept is compelling and Jena is tool that should be considered in implementations of new ontologies. Jena will be ideal for anyone with a understanding of Java.

** Strengths 

* Wide support of RDF and SPARQ
* Support for OWL
* Easy to use API
* Java proficient developers will find the tool easy to use

** Weaknesses 

* Semantic web tools remain niche and lack widespread documentation and user data
* Will depend heavily on users comfort level with Java
